Yimin Shi was born in Shanghai, China, on the second day of 1999. He hopes to live until 2100, so his life can span 2 centuries.

He achieved his B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2021, with third place in GPA. He is currently an M.Comp student specializing in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and will graduate in June 2023. He has accepted his Ph.D. offer from NUS SoC and will restart his journey on this campus for another 4-5 years.

<!-- In recent times Yimin's interest and energy focused on solving the research problems with his directors. From 2019 to 2021 he worked in the HCS lab with Prof. Wei Cai on federated learning-related topics. During this period he published his first conference paper on the ICA3PP 2020, and his first transactions paper on TOSN 2022. In 2022 he started to work with Prof. Richard T. B. Ma in NUS on the streaming processing systems. -->

In the past few years, Yimin applied his energy to solving different research problems. From 2019 to 2021, he worked in the HCS lab with Prof. Wei Cai on edge-assisted federated learning, during which he published his first conference paper on the ICA3PP '20 and his first transactions paper on TOSN '22. From April 2022 to now, he has been focused on resource recommendation problems for stream processing systems like Flink with his master's advisor Prof. Richard T.B. Ma, Mr. Yancan Mao, and people from ByteDance Cloud Infra.

Yimin's habits include reading science fiction and playing Sanda (a kind of Chinese fighting technique). His favorite fiction author is Cixin Liu. He is also interested in understanding the thinking of different people and the physical rules of this world.

Yimin is keeping exploring and never gives up on understanding the meaning of his existence.
